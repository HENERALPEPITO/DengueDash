We dedicate this special problem to all the teachers who have guided us throughout our academic journey. Your knowledge and mentorship have laid the foundation for this research, and for that, we are truly grateful.

To our families, friends, and classmates, thank you for your unwavering support, encouragement, and belief in us. Your presence has been a constant source of strength.

Most especially, we dedicate this work to the health offices and frontline personnel who continue to battle dengue cases with courage and dedication. Your tireless efforts and sacrifices are an inspiration. We hope that this research, in its own small way, can contribute to your work and make a meaningful difference in your fight against this disease.
